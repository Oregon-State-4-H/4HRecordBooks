For example, a speech you gave may be entered both in Section 11 if you gave it at your county contest AND in Section 9 as a Communication in 4-H. For major activities, you might emphasize different aspects of the activity in different sections. As an example, you might enter what you did and the hours you worked at a Community Service project in Section 7, but also enter it Section 5 under Leadership in 4-H if you were the person responsible for organizing the event.</Text>,

  <Text key="li5">Remember that quality is more important than quantity. Don't put things in your record just to fill up space.</Text>
